Zowe CLI contains the ability to access a z/OS component called z/OSMF.

z/OSMF allows accessing datasets (files), jobs and console commands. 

To see the types of file commands we can execute, run `zowe files`{{execute}}

If you wanted to see the options for creating files, run `zowe files create`{{execute}}
