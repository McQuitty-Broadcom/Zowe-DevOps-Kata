Zowe is an integrated and extensible open source framework for z/OS.

Zowe offers modern interfaces to interact with z/OS and allows you to work with z/OS in a way that is similar to what you experience on cloud platforms today. You can use these interfaces as delivered or through plug-ins and extensions that are created by clients or third-party vendors.

Zowe is composed of several components, each improving the learning ability, accessibility, and possibility of mainframe development.
